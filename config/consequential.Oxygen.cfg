[Compatibility]

## Oxygen becomes infinite when the player teleports to mod's places to simplificate gameplay.
## (syncing with host)
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
InfinityOxygenInModsPlaces = true

## Enables oxygen consumption when the helmet's crack level is 2.
## (syncing with host)
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
ImmersiveVisorSupport = false

## How much additional oxygen will be consumed if the helmet's crack level is 2?
## Depends on the secTimer variable.

[General]

## Usually, on the ship, you use oxygen canisters to refill the oxygen, but with this option, you can choose some additional ways.
## 
## "WhenDoorsClosed" - Auto filling works only if the ship's doors are closed.
## "WhenPlayerOnShip" - Works in both situations (doors are open or closed), the player just needs to be on the ship.
## "Off" - Disabled.
## 
## (syncing with host)
# Setting type: AutoFillingOnShip
# Default value: WhenDoorsClosed
# Acceptable values: WhenDoorsClosed, WhenPlayerOnShip, Off
autoFillingOnShip = WhenPlayerOnShip

autoHideHUD = true

## The oxygen HUD disappears if the oxygen value > 'autoHideHUD_value' setting (value from 0 to 1.0).
## You can completely hide the oxygen HUD by setting the 'autoHideHUD_value' to 0.
## If you set the value to 1, this will prevent the oxygen HUD from disappearing.
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 0.75
autoHideHUD_value = 0.75

## If this is set to TRUE, oxygen will be recovered once ship has left.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
