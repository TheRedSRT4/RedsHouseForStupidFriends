## Settings file was created by plugin SCP173 v1.0.1
## Plugin GUID: ProjectSCP.SCP173

[Behaviour]

## How much time in frames will SCP 173 stop moving and doing anything after killing a player
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 1000
Frame after killing = 1000

## At 100, he will 1 shot you. Put it to less if you want him to be way more forgiving
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 100
Amount of damage he does on contact = 100

## SCP 173 works by teleporting around the facility, waiting a few frame for someone to see it, and then teleporting somewhere else. This value represent how much time will he wait at the same location in frame
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 1500
Number Of TP Iteration per frame = 1500

[General]

## The spawn chance weight for SCP173, relative to other existing enemies.
## Goes up from 0, lower is more rare, 100 and up is very common.
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 25
Spawn weight = 25

[Performance]

## SCP 173 works by teleporting a small distance at a super fast speed, each time detecting if he is seen in his new position. The smaller the interval, the more precise SCP173 will be in his teleport, but this also mean that he won't kill you on the same frame you looked away if to small
# Setting type: Single
# Default value: 1
Distance for each TP = 1

## Multiply this value by the Distance for each TP value to get the maximum distance he can do per frame. Do note that this value can affect performance if set to high. Putting it to low will lead to slower speed.
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 100
Number Of TP Iteration per frame = 100
